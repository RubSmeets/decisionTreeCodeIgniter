The data_manipulation folder contains scripts and sql files that where usesd to port the old version of the website to
code-igniter. These scripts performed the necessary data manipulations on the exisiting frameworks_v2.json file and generated
sql files used to setup the database.

NOTE: the scripts here are no longer required and are legacy content. They remain inside the project folder for reference purposes only.

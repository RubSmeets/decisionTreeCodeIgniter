STEP 1:
    Go to config/config.php
    -------
    base_url -> e.g. http://localhost/crossmos_projects/decisionTree2/
    index_page -> (rename index.html to index.php as long as there is nog php open and close syntax it will load like normal html)
    log_treshold -> set to 4 (show all messages)
    encryption_key -> generate the encryption key online (used for session encryption)
    sess_cookie_name -> change the name of the coockies that you want to use or provide (store sesion data)

    Go to config/database.php
    -------
    username -> to your username
    pass -> to your password
    hostname -> ...
    database -> the database name

    Go to config/autoload.php
    -------
    $autoload['helper'] -> load global and frequently used helper packages (e.g. array('url', 'html'))

STEP 2:
    Create first public controller
    -------
    Specify a public controller that provides a landing page where unauthenticated users (everyone)
    can browse to. The public controller also handles login request coming from the public page.

    see public_homepage.php for more information

STEP 3:
    Move existing webpages to the views folder
    -------
    Copy index.html and rename to index.php
    do so for other html files as well.

STEP 4:
    Move existing resources
    -------
    Make sure to copy or move your local scripts/css/resources/etc outside of the codeIgniter application
    folder. This is very important for security!

STEP 5:
    Change the loading of scripts and markup inside your webpage
    -------
    Open index.php and replace the local css loading by:
    - e.g. <?php echo link_tag('css/decisionTree.css'); ?>
    replace the loading of script files by:
    - e.g. <script type="text/javascript" src="<?php echo base_url();?>js/decisionTree.js" ></script>
    change other relative paths to work with code igniter:
    - e.g. images -> <img src="<?php echo base_url('img/logos/smartface.png'); ?>" alt="">

STEP 6:
    First preview
    -------
    Test your webpage by browsing to your base url:
    - e.g. http://localhost/crossmos_projects/decisionTree2/index.php/public_homepage/

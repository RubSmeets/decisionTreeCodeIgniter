The code-igniter models perform the interaction with the MySQL database. They are considered to be the 
database interface layer. The code-igniter query builder is used as much as possible to reduce the change
of sql-injection attacks.

NOTE: I used the models to interact with the database. However, I'm not sure if this is the correct way these
models should be used.

CSS files that have the same name as their SASS counterparts are compiled version of the SASS files. If changes have
to be made to these files you have to edit the SASS file and compile it down to these regular CSS files. See README_SASS
for more information.

The *.css.map files are generated by the sass compiler and used for debugging purposes. These files are not required in 
a production environment.

The bootstrap-social.css file is a modified version (stripped version) of the bootstrap-social plugin. It contains styling
of the google and github social buttons.
